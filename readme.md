Hi! 

Here you will find and Html file and a CSS file. 

This is my first project on Odin and this was also my first time building ANYTHING with html/css. Ive been studying for about a month now so be easy on me. 


Summary: 
In this project it was my job to mimic the google home page (www.Google.com) as close as possible without being a perfectionist. There are some things out of place but I overall it looks very well.
